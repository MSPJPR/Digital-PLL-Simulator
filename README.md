Objective

The project aims to simulate a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) and Clock and Data Recovery (CDR) system through an interactive web interface. It allows users to control and observe the behavior of key PLL parameters such as loop gain, noise, delay, and jitter. The application demonstrates how these factors influence the performance of PLLs and CDR circuits.

Features

1. Interactive Controls:

Adjustable sliders for loop gain, noise level, delay, and jitter.

Real-time updates to the simulation based on user inputs.



2. Dynamic Visualization:

A canvas displays the phase error and frequency response as a sine wave, reflecting real-time PLL behavior.

Noise and jitter are visually represented.



3. Binary Data Simulation:

Displays simulated binary data stream to mimic real-world CDR data streams.

Updates dynamically every second.



4. User-Friendly Interface:

Clean and responsive layout.

Modern CSS styling for improved usability and aesthetics.
